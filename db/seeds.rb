# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# puts "Generating 10 books"

# 10.times do |i|
#   puts "A book is created"
#   Article.create({
#     title: Faker::Book.title,
#     content: Faker::Books::Dune.quote
#   })
# end

# puts "10 books generated!"
